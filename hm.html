  <h1>Morphological Processing for Languages of the Horn of Africa</h1>

  <h2>What is HornMorpho?</h2>
  <p>
  HornMorpho is a program written in the Python programming language
  that does morphological analysis and generation of words in seven
  languages of the Horn of Africa.
  </p>

  <h2>Who is it for?</h2>
  <p>
  To use HornMorpho, you should
  <ol>
    <li>be at least somewhat familiar with Python programming
    <li>know at least one of the languages covered by the program, and
    <li>know some basic morphological terms and concepts, for example, <i>root</i>, <i>suffix</i>, <i>tense</i>,
    and <i>person</i>
</ol>

  <h2>What can you do with it?</h2>
  <p>
  The purpose of HornMorpho is to analyze or generate morphologically complex
  words in one of the languages covered.
  Morphologically complex words are those consisting of multiple morphemes,
  that is, a root or stem and one or more prefixes, suffixes, or "templates"
  (more about these later).
  For example, the Amharic noun ለጓደኞቿ <i>lǝgʷaddǝññoččʷa</i> 'to her
  friends', consists of the stem ጓደኛ <i>gʷaddǝñña</i>, the suffixes
  ኦች <i>-očč</i> 'plural' and ዋ <i>-wa</i> 'her', and the
  prepositional prefix (or case marker) ለ <i>lǝ-</i> 'to'.
<!--  Nouns and adjectives in the languages covered include ways of
  indicating case ("subject", "direct object", etc.) in addition to
  number ("singular", "plural") and possession.
-->    
  </p>
  The most complex words in all of these languages are verbs, which
  indicate tense-aspect-modality ("past", "continuous", "imperative",
  etc.), subject agreement ("1st person singular", "2nd person feminine plural", etc.),
  derivational categories ("passive", "causative", etc.), and a number of other
  features, depending on the language.
  Verbs are the main focus of HornMorpho.
  </p>
  <p>
  Other words &mdash; prepositions, postpositions, conjunctions,
  adverbs &mdash; are mostly ignored by HornMorpho since they either
  have no internal structure or consist of fixed forms that are
  treated as lexical items (words) rather than as analyzable forms.
  For example, the Amharic adverb በተጨማ <i>bǝtǝč'ǝmmari</i> 'in
  addition' is derived from the verb root &lt;č'mr&gt; 'add', but it
  appears in this form so often that an analysis of the word is not
  particularly helpful.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Morphological analysis</strong> takes a word and either finds the root or
  stem and a set of grammatical features or segments the word into its
    constituent morphemes.
    I will refer to the first of these as "grammatical analysis" and
  the second as "segmentation"
    For example, grammatical analysis applied to the Amharic noun
  ለጓደኞቿ yields <span class='gram'>stem</span>=ጓደኛ, <span
class='gram'>poss=3sf</span>, <span class='gram'>num=plur</span>,
<span class='gram'>prep=</span>ለ. That is, this noun has the stem ጓደኛ
  ('friend'), plural number, a 3rd person singular feminine
possessive, and the preposition (or case marker) ለ.
"Stemming" or "lemmatization" is a subset of the process of
  grammatical analysis; it returns only the stem, root, or lemma (a
  canonical form of the stem or root) of the word, in this case ጓደኛ <i>gʷaddǝñña</i>.
Segmentation applied to the same word yields
ለ-&lt;ጓደኛ&gt;-ኦች-ዋ (or <i>lǝ-&lt;gʷaddǝñña&gt;-očč-wa</i>).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Morphological generation</strong> is the reverse process. It starts with a root
or stem and a set of grammatical features and outputs a word form.
For example, given <span class='gram'>stem</span>=ጓደኛ, <span
class='gram'>poss=3sf</span>, <span class='gram'>num=plur</span>,
<span class='gram'>prep=</span>ለ, generation yields the word ለጓደኞቿ.
</p>
  <p>
  Why would you want a program that does morphological analysis or generation?
  Languages with complex morphology suffer from the problem of data scarcity.
  Such languages have many more possible words than a language such as
  English or French, and most of the possible words have little
  likelihood of occurring in a given corpus or of occurring so few
times that it is impossible to generalize about them.
  If you are training a machine translation system, a speech
  recognition system, or a parser in such a language, it may be
  possible to alleviate the data sparsity problem by replacing words
  with grammatical analyses, stems, or lemmas.
