# Amharic ambiguity categories

## Features

1. Noun or adjective possessive suffixes vs. definite determiners  

	The noun suffixes -ኡ and -ዋ are usually ambiguous; they can either function as possessives (= English 'his' or 'her') or as definite articles (= English 'the'). Sometimes they are genuinely ambiguous, that is, impossible to disambiguate (except probabilistically) given only one sentence.
   
   The suffix can also appear on an adjective modifying a noun or an adjective functioning as a noun.
  
   * -ኡ
   	
   			እናቱ ናፈቀችው ።  
   			Gender[psor]=Masc|Number[psor]=Sing|Person[psor]=3
   		
   			ፕሬዚዴንቱ ንግግር አደረጉ ።  
   			Definite=Def|Gender=Masc
   			
   			ትልቁን መረጥኩ ።
   			Definite=Def|Gender=Masc
   			
   			[ambiguous]   
   			በቱን ተከራየ ። 
   			
   * -ዋ

   			ባሏ ናፈቃት ።  
   			Gender[psor]=Fem|Number[psor]=Sing|Person[psor]=3
   			
   			[possibly ambiguous]
   			አይጧ ጠፋች ።  
   			Definite=Def|Gender=Fem
   			
   			[ambiguous]
   			ድመቷ ጠፋች ።
   			

2. Relative verbs with object suffixes vs. definite determiners

This corresponds to 1. for suffixes on relative verbs that modify nouns or functions as nouns.
In this case, there is only ambiguity between the masculine article and possessive.

4. 3sf vs. 2sm
