### FST which covers details of the Amharic verb stem.
### The prefixes a-, as-, te-, as well as the gemination of the stem initial consonsant
### that indicates passive voice for imperfective and jussive, are treated with separate
### states.
### Root/stem categories treated more or less separately in this FST:
### "A" roots: CCC, including those with initial laryngeal (addere), final laryngeal (bella),
###    and original final "y" (mexxe)
### special "A" roots, with C2=w|y|', behaving in many ways like 2-consonant verbs
### "B" roots: CC_C (fellege)
### 4-consonant and 5-consonant roots: CCCC (kelekkele), CCCCC (wexeneggere),
###    C|CCCC (teCberebbere)
### Stems with "a" before second-to-last consonants, including
###    "C" roots: CaCC (bakkene)
###    CCaCC roots: (tekenawwene)
###    C|CaCC roots: (tensaffefe)
###    C|CCaCC roots (tenSebarreqe)
###    iterative stem of "A" and "B" roots: CCaCC (sebabbere)
###    iterative stem of CCCC roots: (genefaffele)
###
### All occurrences of "o" and "u" in stems are treated as originating from labialized
### consonants in the root. For example,
### qureT <- qWIreT <- qWrT (an ordinary 3-consonant root)
### doleddome <- dWeledW_eme <- dWldWl (an ordinary 4-consonant root)
###

#### PREFIXES

## Transitive a-
start -> a          [a:]      [vc=tr]
## Passive te- (perfective, gerundive, imperative)
start -> te         <te:>     [vc=ps,tm=prf];[vc=ps,tm=ger];[tm=j_i,vc=ps,sp=2,-neg]
## Causative as-
start -> as         <as:>
# for C1=L verbs, +iterative
as -> ast           [t:]      [vc=tr]
te -> test          <st:>    [as=it]
## Passive in imperfective, jussive is special because te- is replaced by ...
# ... tt for verbs with C1=L: yIttawweqal, yIttewawweqal
start -> tt         <t_:>     [vc=ps,tm=imf];[vc=ps,tm=j_i,sp=1];[vc=ps,tm=j_i,sp=3];[vc=ps,tm=j_i,sp=2,+neg]
start -> ij_ps      [:]       [tm=imf,vc=ps];[tm=j_i,vc=ps,sp=1];[tm=j_i,vc=ps,sp=3];[tm=j_i,vc=ps,sp=2,+neg]
# ... gemination of the following consonant (C1!=L): yImmerreTal, yImmerarreTal
ij_ps -> i/         [/:]
# ... 0 when the root begins with C|: yInsaffefal, yICberebberal
ij_ps -> i|         [:]

## Combine causative, passive, and transitive prefixes, along with
## no prefix in one state (simp) because they are common to most roots
# Causative
as -> simp          [:]       [vc=cs]
# Passive (perfective, gerundive, imperative)
te -> simp          [:]
# Prevent reciprocal and iterative aspect (which need a/)
a -> simp           [:]       [as=smp]
# Simplex voice: no stem prefix
start -> simp       [:]       [vc=smp]

# Transitive and passive before C| verbs is special
a -> a_te           [:]
te -> a_te          [:]

# Transitive iterative, reciprocal: geminate C1 after the prefix
a -> a/             [/:]

#### END
### State names with "-" represent positions starting from the right:
###   -1 is right before the last consonant
###  -2V is right before the vowel following the second to last consonant
